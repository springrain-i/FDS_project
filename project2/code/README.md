## Compile and Run
To run this program,you need a C compiler installed on your computer.If you don't have one,you can install a compiler like GCC or use an online compiler.

To compile and run,you shoule open a terminal and naviget to the correct dictory:

<center><b> Make Sure you are in the correct dictory!</b></center>
<center><b> The Number is the testcase in data</b></center>

**Example**:
In Wondows
```c
cd ./code/
gcc BST.c -o BST
.\BST.exe -w -8
```
Then you can see the 8out.txt in the data folder which is the output.
### For Linux Users
If you are using Linux, you can use the following commands to compile and run the program.
```
cd ./code/
gcc BST.c -o BST
./BST -l -(NUMBER)
```
### For Windows Users
If you are using Windows, you can use the following commands to compile and run the program.
```
cd .\code\
gcc BST.c -o BST
.\BST.exe -w -(NUMBER)
```

## Inputs and Output
You can input the testcase according to the requirements of the question.

<center><b> Please Make Sure Your Tree Is Right!</b></center>

And I have provided some testcases in the Data folder, you can use them to test the program.

You can replace the input files by naming `x.in` in `.\data `
But it can't be more than 10
> Tips
> Some testcases may be too large to be copied,so you need to be patient to wait the input.And the output may be also very slow and large,so would you mind waiting a little longer.
